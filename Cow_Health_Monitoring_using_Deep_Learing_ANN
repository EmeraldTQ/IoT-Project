IoT-Based Cow Health Monitoring Using Deep Learning
This notebook presents the development of a deep learning-based classification model for monitoring cow health and behavior using IoT sensor data. The goal is to predict whether a cow is ruminating or not based on accelerometer (Ax, Ay, Az) and gyroscope (Gx, Gy, Gz) readings collected from wearable sensors.

A PyTorch-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was implemented to analyze sensor readings and classify cow movements. The model was trained using Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCELoss) and optimized using AdamW. Various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization techniques were applied to improve performance.

Despite extensive tuning, the model did not achieve high accuracy, and this notebook analyzes the possible reasons behind it while suggesting improvements.

Why is the Accuracy Low? 

Despite improvements, the model's accuracy remains suboptimal, and several key factors contribute to this issue:

1. The dataset has more non-ruminating movements than ruminating ones.
The model leans toward predicting the majority class, leading to low precision for ruminating cows.
Fix Attempted: Used SMOTE to address class imbalance, but further tuning is needed.

2. Overlapping Sensor Data
Some movements (e.g., standing vs. ruminating) have similar sensor readings.
The model struggles to differentiate between them, leading to misclassifications.

3. Learning Rate Might Be Too Low  (lr = 0.0005)
A very small learning rate causes slow weight updates, leading to slow improvement in loss.
Fix Attempted: Increasing lr=0.001 could help the model converge faster.

4. Limited Model Complexity
The model might lack the complexity needed to capture hidden patterns in sensor data.
Fix Attempted: Increasing neurons/layers improved performance slightly, but more feature engineering may be required.
