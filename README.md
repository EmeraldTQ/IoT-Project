# 🐄 IoT-Based Cow Health Monitoring System  

### 📌 Overview  
This project is an **IoT-powered system** for **monitoring cow health**. It collects **temperature, movement (accelerometer/gyroscope), and ruminating activity data** from IoT sensors, CCTV, processes it using **deep learning (ANN)**, and provides an intuitive **Streamlit dashboard** for easy visualization. Alerts are sent via **email/SMS** if abnormal health conditions are detected.  

### 🔥 Features  
✅ **Real-time IoT data collection** (Temperature, Accelerometer, Gyroscope)  
✅ **AI-powered health classification** (Healthy / Not Healthy)  
✅ **Streamlit dashboard for farmers**  
✅ **Email/SMS alerts for abnormal conditions**  


### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Hardware:** IoT sensors (Temperature, Accelerometer, Gyroscope)  
- **Deep Learning:** (ANN Model)  
- **Backend:** 
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (for dashboard visualization)  
- **Deployment:**
